# baumkuchen_exercise
Part of the group exercise HW due 1/29/21
Step 1)
  Create a dictonary.txt file which will hold the German word and translate it ifthere is a translation for it.
  
Step 2)
  Your task is to create a (funny) story with the given German words. This storyis supposed to use at least 10 of the German words.  Your story can of course be in     English and incorporate the words in any way you want to. This is supposed to be funand lightweight, it is not about having a perfect story and has nothing really to do withSE just that you use Git and hopefully have some fun with your team members.To do so you work on your story.txt file (put it in you repo). Each of you add onesentence at a time to the story which you can do directly on master or create branches forit to practice working with branches â€“ might be a good idea (you can work asynchronouslyon this), if you get a conflict resolve it so the story still makes some sense or not ;-)).Each sentence should use one of the 10 words (or more). So overall you will end up withroughly 10 sentences and each of you should write 2 of them (your 2 sentences should notfollow one another). So you need to check in on this at least twice!It is not allowed to merge sentences into the story only append at the end (otherwise itwould not be as difficult and fun).When you are done then post your story AND your GitHub link to our #story channelwith your group name as first line, so we know who it is for.
  
Step 3)
  Each of you should go to at least one other GitHub repo from another team (seelinks on #story channel) and clone that repo, create a new branch (name should be yourasurite) and create a PullRequest for their repo to add your new sentance to their story!The team should review all incoming PullRequests and either approve or decline witha reasoning.Step 3)Vote for your favorite Story with thumbsup on Slack #story.
