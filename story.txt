The story of team baumkuchen.

The story begins.....

It was a pleasant morning, and Gauss decided to walk to work instead of drive his BMW. Along the way, he decided to stop by his favorite baeckerei and buy a gebaeck.
While Gauss was eating his gebaeck, he heard the sound of his favorite musik from the band rammstein play in the distance.
