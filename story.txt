The story of team baumkuchen.

The story begins.....

It was a pleasant morning, and Gauss decided to walk to work instead of drive his BMW. Along the way, he decided to stop by his favorite baeckerei and buy a gebaeck.
While Gauss was eating his gebaeck, he heard the sound of his favorite musik from the band rammstein play in the distance.
He started to day dream of simpler times in the '90s, but the cool breeze of the klimaanlage brought him back to reality as he finished his gebaeck.
