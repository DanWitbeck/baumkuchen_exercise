The story of team baumkuchen.

The story begins.....

It was a pleasant morning, and Gauss decided to walk to work instead of drive his BMW. Along the way, he decided to stop by his favorite baeckerei and buy a gebaeck.
While Gauss was eating his gebaeck, he heard the sound of his favorite musik from the band rammstein play in the distance.
He started to day dream of simpler times in the '90s, but the cool breeze of the klimaanlage brought him back to reality as he finished his gebaeck.
It reminded him of his earlier days in Munich wearing lederhosen.
And partying in the biergarten, with his long greasy beard.
Gauss left the baeckerei and decided to depart from his normal work route and head toward Munich.
When all of a suden Guass saw a hund run past his path.
He bumped into a professor Mehlhase who was wearing a Dirndel.
"Hello Gauss, it's almost 9:00am, you're going to be late to work; let me give you a ride in my Porsche" Mehlhase says.
"Sure but you have to let me drive" said Gauss, he took the keys from Melhase and stuck it in the schloss of his porsche. 
"I am loving this porsche! It's almost wettbewerbsfaehig with BMW!" Guass excalimed.
